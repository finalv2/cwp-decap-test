We spent 10 months rebuilding of the Child Welfare Playbook, and we're so excited to share it with you.

The new playbook includes:

* Strategies that have been reviewed with experts, standardized, and re-organized to improve their clarity and usefulness. This makes it easier for you to implement and contribute to them.
* Stories and resources from child welfare professionals across the country.
* Recordings and presentations from monthly working group meetings.
* A new navigation and search system that makes it easier to find what you're looking for, including strategies, stories, resources, and meeting materials.
* A new visual design that is fully accessible and designed for mobile devices.

## How we rebuilt the playbook

We conducted research with working group members to understand how they used the website and what they wanted to improve. Then, we audited all of the information on the website to create a new content strategy and navigation system.

We tested a prototype of the new website with working group members and other stakeholders. They told us that they wanted it to be clear, practical, and navigable. They also confirmed what many of you had already told us: You use the website as a reference tool and appreciate that it's practical, but it's hard to find the information you need.

Based on that, we updated the websiteâ€™s organization to match the most important topics in your work. We also streamlined and standardized strategies to make them easier for you to adopt and adapt. Many of the strategies were written with subject-matter experts who work in the child welfare system.

## Join the community

The new playbook creates a foundation for continued growth and improvement. We've established new feedback mechanisms that make it easier to add strategies, stories, and resources. We've also created new content types to showcase your work and research in the field.
