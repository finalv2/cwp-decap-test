Federal rules now allow child welfare agencies to create separate approval processes for kin caregivers. To implement these changes effectively, a group was assembled to develop model standards. The group included 9 national organizations, over 50 agencies, and more than 430 individual participants, including kin caregivers and agency staff.Â 

This collaboration developed new licensing standards that focus on two key components: background checks and kinship caregiver assessments. It also produced ready-to-use forms, templates, and implementation guidance.

Now, the key recommendations from these standards are available as strategies and resources in the Child Welfare Playbook.
