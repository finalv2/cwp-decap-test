Child welfare agencies use different terms for the same roles and practices. Here’s the terminology that we use in the Child Welfare Playbook and what it means.

## Caregiver

We use *caregiver* to describe any adult providing care to a child. This includes:

* **Foster parents**: Any adults who are licensed to provide 24-hour care for a child in the child welfare system. We use *foster parent* rather than terms like *resource parent* or *community caregiver*.
* **Kin caregivers**: Relatives and other people who have pre-existing emotional relationships to the child and provide care for them. We use *kin* rather than *kinship*.
* **Residential staff**: Any adults who work and provide care in a residential facility.

## Kin engagement

We use *kin engagement* to describe the overall practice of identifying, finding, and building connections with kin who may be able to care for a child in the foster care system.
