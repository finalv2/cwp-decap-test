title: Out-of-state child abuse and neglect checks (Adam Walsh checks)
intro: >-
  If a prospective foster parent lived in another state within the last 5 years,
  their current state must check the child abuse and neglect registry from their
  prior state before approving them as foster parents.


  This sounds like a good idea. But in practice, inconsistent processes across states for fulfilling these requests are putting children at risk, and cause some of the most significant delays in licensing (paying) foster parents, particularly for kinship caregivers who already have placement of children but who do not receive any financial support until they are licensed.


  As a result, some states have implemented these universal policies:


  * **39 states** accept electronic requests

  * **10 states** accept attestation of consent

  * **50 states** have a general inbox for receiving requests

  * **40 states** don't require a fee

  * **41 states** don't require a notarized or witnessed signature
