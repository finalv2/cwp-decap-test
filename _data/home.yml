  All young people should get to grow up safely and with people who care about
  them. This playbook gives you strategies to prevent family separation and
  improve outcomes for children and youth in the child welfare system. Each
  strategy includes guidance, examples, and resources for implementing it in
  your location.


  The playbook is the product of a working group of child welfare professionals from every state, many tribes, and most territories. We meet every month to develop and refine its strategies.
