## What we do

The Child Welfare Playbook is a collection of proven, practical strategies to prevent family separation and improve outcomes for children and youth in the child welfare system. We bring together child welfare agencies from across the country to identify successful approaches, document them clearly, and make them available for anyone to adopt.

Everything in the playbook is designed for immediate use, including templates, checklists, policy language, and implementation guides. We believe in sharing what we learn, so feel free to copy anything you find useful.

## How we do it

The playbook is developed by a working group of child welfare professionals from every state, many tribes, and most territories. The group meets every month to focus on specific child welfare challenges. Outside of our monthly meetings, [Bloom Works](https://bloomworks.digital/) collaborates with working group members to design, develop, and write the playbook.

The work is supported by the A.L. Mailman Family Foundation, [Aviv Foundation](https://www.avivfoundation.org/), [Ballmer Group](https://www.ballmergroup.org/), [Beeck Center for Social Impact & Innovation](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu), [Doris Duke Foundation](https://www.dorisduke.org/), [Foster America](https://www.foster-america.org/), [Greenbridge Family Foundation](https://www.greenbridge.foundation/), [New America](https://www.newamerica.org/new-practice-lab/), [North Forty Group](https://raikesfoundation.org), [Schmidt Futures](https://www.schmidtfutures.com), [Stand Together Trust](https://standtogether.org), and [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org/).
