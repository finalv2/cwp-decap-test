## Our mission

The Child Welfare Playbook is a collection of proven, practical strategies to prevent family separation and improve outcomes for children and youth in the child welfare system. We bring together child welfare agencies from across the country to identify successful approaches, document them clearly, and make them available for anyone to adopt.

## How we work

Every month, our nationwide working group focuses on a specific child welfare challenge. We interview practitioners, share findings and emerging practices, and document successful strategies in the playbook. These collaborative sessions generate practical, field-tested approaches that any jurisdiction can implement.

All playbook content is designed for immediate use, including templates, checklists, policy language, and implementation guides. We believe in sharing what we learn, so feel free to copy anything you find useful.

## Join our community

The Child Welfare Playbook working group includes participants from every state, most territories, and many title IV-E tribes. We welcome any child welfare agency, organization, or individual with expertise to join us.

Participation is free and requires just two hours a month. Members get the following benefits:

* Access to promising practices in ready-to-use formats
* Comparative data on practices across jurisdictions
* Opportunities to participate in cross-state projects
* Implementation assistance for adapting strategies
