Many caseworkers have full caseloads, which means that they don’t always have time to explain every program to every youth. This can lead to youth missing out on opportunities to prepare for independence.

Allow youth to look through a list of available programming and choose the topics that are most relevant to them.

### How to do this

**Provide a list of available programs.** You can print it out or email it to them. Ask them to circle or highlight the programs that interest them.

**Create online programming calendars.** Set up a programming calendar online and allow youth to RSVP for programs of interest, using a free tool like Google Forms or Eventbrite.
