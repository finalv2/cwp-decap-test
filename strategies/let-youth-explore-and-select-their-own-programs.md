Many caseworkers have full caseloads, which means that they donâ€™t always have time to explain every program to every youth. This can lead to youth missing out on opportunities to prepare for independence.

Allow youth to look through a list of available programming and choose the topics that are most relevant to them.

### How to do this

**Provide a list of available programs.** You can print it out or email it to them. Ask them to circle or highlight the programs that interest them.

**Create online programming calendars.** Set up a programming calendar online and allow youth to RSVP for programs of interest, using a free tool like Google Forms or Eventbrite.
