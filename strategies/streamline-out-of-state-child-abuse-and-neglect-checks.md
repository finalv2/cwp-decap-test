Out-of-state child abuse and neglect registry checks (often referred to as Adam Walsh checks) can take months to complete and delay approvals for foster families that are ready to care for children. They are particularly burdensome for kin caregivers who already have children in their home, but cannot get licensed until this step is complete.

Process check requests faster by handling them efficiently and removing administrative barriers.

## How to do this

**Accept and fulfill requests electronically.** Processing out-of-state child abuse and neglect registry checks through the mail creates delays and opportunities for errors. Instead, process requests electronically:

* Create a secure email address for receiving and fulfilling requests from other states.  
* Use the [model template form](https://www.grandfamilies.org/Resources/Kin-Specific-Licensing-Standards-Sample-Forms). Any additional data fields, formatting requirements, or steps beyond the model template should be eliminated if not absolutely required by state law.  
* Convert your form to a fillable PDF or web form.  
* If you need to make system IT upgrades, consider using a web-based system for accepting and fulfilling these requests in the meantime. Make sure to allow multiple users in a state to make requests.

**Use a general inbox for requests.** Requests that go to an email address that only one person in your agency can access creates delays when that staff member goes on vacation, gets sick, or retires. Make sure multiple staff members can access the email address for requests, rather than directing requests to a specific individual. If you don’t already have one, develop a policy in your agency that includes who should submit and follow up on all requests, and specify that you’ll fulfill requests within 1 week. 

**Let agencies attest they have consent.** Requiring a separate consent form for each individual being checked with every request creates extra paperwork and delays. Instead, allow the requesting agency to check a box to confirm that they have consent on file. This dramatically reduces the time and complexity of completing checks.

**Don't require notarized or witnessed signatures.** It's hard for a social worker to gather all household applicants together at once to visit a notary or witness, and this step doesn't provide any safety benefits. Remove requirements for notarized or witnessed signatures on consent forms. Accept regular signatures instead.

**Remove processing fees.** For some states, it's so difficult to issue a check to another state (even for a few dollars) that many licensing workers report paying these fees out of their own pockets. Even if they can pay, fees create extra work and delay the process. Remove any fees you charge other agencies for processing requests.

## This strategy in action

**Compare which jurisdictions** have implemented these promising practices at the [Out-of-State Child Abuse and Neglect dashboard](https://childwelfareplaybook.com/compare/background-checks/).

**All jurisdictions** can use and adapt the template for requesting out-of-state child abuse and neglect checks that are part of the [kin licensing forms](https://www.grandfamilies.org/Resources/Kin-Specific-Licensing-Standards-Sample-Forms).[](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V30W6Ft_uEUpVIQ062wPh12HrYHNod0b43T25wrp190/edit?tab%3Dt.0%23heading%3Dh.yd2gyy5b38kz&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1750798774259355&usg=AOvVaw2yTL2zyUIGHpRFEo_0wQvZ)
