Childcare can be a major barrier to potential caregivers. It can stop them from attending training, recognition events, and support groups. You can make it easier for them by providing childcare on-site.

This helps more caregivers complete your licensing process, and do it faster. It also increases attendance at training and events, and builds community among caregivers. It may even help you find new caregivers through childcare volunteers.

## How to do this

**Provide childcare for required agency steps.** This is especially important for kin caregivers who need to complete requirements to keep their placement, like fingerprinting or medical exams.

**Use community volunteers when possible.** If your policy allows it, look for community members who can volunteer to provide childcare. This can be a smart recruitment strategy too, as it introduces more people to children in care and the idea of fostering.

**Include all children in the home.** Offer childcare for both children in care and other children in the home.

**Keep it simple.** The childcare doesn't have to be fancy. Putting on a movie can be enough.

**Complete required background checks.** Depending on your policies, you may need to do background checks on childcare providers first.

## This strategy in action
