With foster homes in such high demand, it's all too easy to keep making placements in a home until the family burns out and quits. Families that are feeling overwhelmed might benefit from respite or taking lower-need children for a time, while families that are gaining experience may be ready to take on higher-need placements.

Use renewal as an opportunity to touch base with families about their current needs and goals. This helps retain families longer and may identify families who are ready to take on more responsibility and train for higher-need placements.

## How to do this

**Keep a spreadsheet or calendar of renewal dates.** Before the license renewal process begins, schedule a check-in call with the family. Review their current and recent placements before the call.

**If a family has had or recently had a stressful placement or disruption,** consider options that might give them a break, including stepping down to take lower-need placements, being placed on hold, or becoming a respite placement.

**If a family has become more experienced and seems interested,** use this conversation to talk to them about what a higher-need placement might look like and what trainings or experiences are available to them.

## This strategy in action

**Washington State** uses renewal check-ins to assess family capacity and match families with appropriate placement opportunities.
