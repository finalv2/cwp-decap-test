Safety inspections often delay the licensing process when families don't know what items they need ahead of time, can't afford required safety equipment, or have to wait for return visits to resolve minor issues. Provide support throughout the inspection process so families can pass inspections quickly and staff spend less time on return visits.

## How to do this

**Provide inspection checklists early and often.** Give safety inspection checklists to families in multiple places and at multiple points during the process: in orientation packets, online with other application materials, in appointment reminders, with renewal reminders, and in your online licensing tracker application if you have one.

**Collect critical safety items and give them to families who need them.** The most frequently needed items include fire extinguishers, baby gates, first aid kits, and medication lock boxes. You can collect these items through safety inspection drives, similar to backpack or food drives. Work with local partners like churches to host drive events or fundraisers, or use Family Preservation Service dollars to buy items.

**Keep a stash of essentials in locations that are easy to access.** You might use a supply closet or the trunk of a caseworker's car. You can also provide important items at training or orientation.

**Simplify how you resolve minor issues.** Allow families to send photos to confirm that they have resolved minor pending inspection items rather than requiring return visits for validation. Create a list of inspection items that can be resolved by photograph, such as beds, smoke detectors, and home repairs. Tell families with minor pending items to send a photo once the item has been resolved and store the photo with the family's file. If you use a foster family online portal, request the ability for families to upload photo attachments.

## This strategy in action

**Rhode Island** provides safety checklists for families in English and Spanish and accepts photos to resolve minor inspection items.

**Washington State** uses statute-aligned checklists that families receive ahead of inspections.

**California**, **Indiana**, and **Rhode Island** provide safety inspection items to families in need and accept photos to resolve minor pending items.[](https://childwelfareplaybook.com/static/assets/resolve_minor_pending_items_asset2)
