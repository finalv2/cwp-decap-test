Caregivers need support beyond what your agency can provide. Help caregivers identify and plan how to use their natural support networks early in the process so they can be activated when needed.

## How to do this

**Add natural supports to your home study process.** Update your home study to include identifying the caregiver's support network.

**Use scenario-based conversations.** Have home study specialists talk through different hypothetical scenarios with caregivers to prompt brainstorming about what supports they would need and who they would reach out to.

**Document the support plans.** Have families write down their support plans so they can reference them later.

## This strategy in action

**Washington State** asks caregivers about their natural support network as part of its home study form.
