Vague references to "services" or "resources" donâ€™t make it clear to families why you're calling or what help is available. This makes them less likely to engage. Tell families exactly what items or assistance you can provide to build trust and show immediate value.

## How to do this

**Update your contact scripts to be specific.** Change initial contact scripts or guidelines to mention specific offerings, such as free diapers, car seats, or rental assistance. Don't use unclear terms like "services" or "resources."

**Lead with simple, popular items.** If you offer many services, start with simple, popular services that require minimal commitment, such as free diapers.

## This strategy in action

**Michigan** co-designed their outreach scripts with individuals with lived experience. They report that clarity about what services they can offer in the first 20 seconds of the call is important. For example: "Are you all good on coats? How about holiday gifts?"

**Hello Baby in Allegheny County** reports success in offering free diapers as an entry point. From there, they can engage more with families that may need additional support.
