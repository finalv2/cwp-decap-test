Youth often end up in group homes even when the alternatives haven't been explored. A dedicated team (called a “red team”) may be able to find other placements.

Use a red team to conduct kin research, construct a genogram, and ask youth directly about possible placements. Empower the team to brainstorm, make decisions, and pursue alternatives.

## How to do this

**Assemble a diverse team.** Include team members with strong problem solving skills. Make sure to appoint a team lead.

**State the goal.** The main goal of the red team is to find an alternative placement to group homes for every youth.

**Require a red team meeting before group home placements.** You might also require a meeting in other scenarios, like placing a youth out of state or in a general foster home with unrelated youth.

**Ask about connections.** As part of their process, the red team should construct a genogram and plan to ask youth about possible placement options.

## This strategy in action

**Rhode Island** requires a red team meeting before any group placement, or any placement into a home that already has at least 1 other unrelated foster child. The meeting is led by the department's chief of staff.
