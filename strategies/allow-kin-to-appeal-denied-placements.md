Kin caregivers have a right to appeal if your agency decides that youth should not live with them.

If you don’t already have an appeals process, set one up. Make sure kin understand how to request a reconsideration.

## How to do this

**Clearly explain why you denied the placement.** Thank kin for offering their home, and give them a clear, specific reason why your agency didn’t place the youth with them. This could be a disqualifying issue from their background check or a decision to place youth with another caregiver. 

**Make this a conversation.** Don’t just send a form letter. Talk with the caregiver about this decision, and listen to any concerns they might have. Let them know they can still play an active role in the youth’s life through visits and other support. 

**Tell kin how to appeal.** If your agency doesn’t currently have an appeal process, create one that both kin and staff can easily follow. Kin can appeal when your decision is based on criminal record results, home licensing standards, or your assessment of the youth’s needs. They should describe the issue they’d like resolved, anything your agency might not know about, what outcome they’re looking for, and any accommodations they’d need during the appeals process.

**Respond quickly to requests.** While an appeals process can take days or months, your agency should respond to the initial request within a set number of business days. Let kin know your timeframe upfront and what to expect throughout the process. 

**Provide clear contact information.** Let kin know exactly who at your agency they can talk to about their appeal. This could be a program supervisor or manager. Provide direct contact information, such as phone numbers and email address.

**Consider bringing in a neutral mediator.** When a dispute can’t be resolved by a program supervisor or manager, consider a professional mediator who can help ease tensions and resolve any conflict between your agency and kin. This could be the office of ombudsperson or a child welfare mediation program. Tell potential kin caregivers what this mediation process looks like, and who to contact if they're in need of these services. 

## This strategy in action

**All jurisdictions** can adapt the [denial and appeal letter template](https://www.grandfamilies.org/Resources/Kin-Specific-Licensing-Standards-Sample-Forms) to explain the reason for a disqualification and next steps for appealing it. 

**Utah, New Mexico, New York,** and a number of other states and countieshave child welfare mediation programs.
