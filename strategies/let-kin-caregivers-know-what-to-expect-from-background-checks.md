Some kin caregivers may feel anxious about the background check process, a fear rooted in past harms and learned mistrust of the child welfare system. Others worry they might be disqualified for issues that shouldn’t matter in placement decisions, such as decades-old minor convictions.

How you explain this process can make the difference in whether kin caregivers feel safe to engage and move forward.

## How to do this

**Be specific about the benefits of approval.** Being approved as a formal kin caregiver means their household will get money to help with related expenses, and they’ll be able to make decisions around local school enrollment and medical care. They’ll also have input on when and how youth interact with previous caregivers until they can reunite.

**Explain each step upfront.** Explain that the process to get approved as a formal kin caregiver includes checks of criminal background records, child abuse and neglect records, and sex offender registry records in any states they and other adults in the home have lived in the past 5 years, along with a home and caregiver assessment. Tell them you recognize this process will look into sensitive information about their history, home, and other adults they live with.

Reassure them:

* If they don't have the required identity documents, are missing fingers, or don't have fingerprints due to age or exposure to chemicals, you can do a name-based criminal background check instead. Your agency should have a process to approve them using agency or state funds in these cases.
* Having a record doesn’t mean they won’t get approved. You’ll review background check results case by case and talk with the kin household to make sure there’s nothing from the past that could affect the safety and well-being of the youth. 

**Make help available.** Work with kin applicants to fill out any forms together. Ask if kin need forms in another language, help because of a disability or circumstance, or want something explained more clearly. Connect them with concrete resources and support, including other kin caregivers who have been through the process.

**Only proceed with their consent.** Kin should know what they are agreeing to and what their rights are. Consider having them review a [background check consent form](https://www.grandfamilies.org/Resources/Kin-Specific-Licensing-Standards-Sample-Forms). Give them time to look it over. If they decide to move forward with the process and sign a consent form, give them a copy. This form can also serve as your agency’s attestation.

## This strategy in action

**Oregon** uses meeting facilitators who hold family engagement meetings as early in a case as possible. They share approval requirements upfront and explain workarounds for concerns like deportation or background history. They also have a letter explaining the process to kin, assuring them that the agency is not looking for perfection.

**Texas** uses kinship navigators to hold these conversations with kin. They also put their background check form on a tablet that kin caregivers can fill out and sign anywhere.

**All jurisdictions** can use and adapt the model [kin licensing forms](https://www.grandfamilies.org/Resources/Kin-Specific-Licensing-Standards-Sample-Forms) that include:

* Background check consent form 
* Background check application form
* Fingerprint identification options
