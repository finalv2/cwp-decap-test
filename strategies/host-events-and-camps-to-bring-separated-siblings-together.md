Siblings who are separated in foster care often miss out on opportunities to build memories and maintain their bond through shared experiences. Regular visits may keep siblings connected, but special events and camps create positive shared experiences that strengthen sibling relationships and give them fun memories to carry forward. Host events and camps that bring separated siblings together.

## How to do this

**Host a monthly event for separated siblings.** Make it fun and seasonal. It could be as simple as meeting at a playground or petting zoo, or an existing community event like an outdoor kids' concert. Your foster parent support groups may be able to volunteer to coordinate events, or at least suggest locations or existing events to join.

**Invite separated siblings to existing events.** If you are already having a community event, invite the families of all separated siblings to attend.

**Create a summer camp for separated siblings.** This can be challenging to start, but you can collaborate with local nonprofits, existing summer camps, and other states with existing sibling camps to create a pilot program for next summer. It could be an afternoon in the park with agency employees running activities at first; it doesn't have to be a week-long sleepaway camp.

**Send separated sibling groups to an ordinary camp.** You don't need a special camp for separated siblings. You could raise funds or provide grants to send siblings to existing camps.

## This strategy in action

**Maryland** has Camp Connect, a sleepaway camp for siblings in foster care. Department employees can sign up to work shifts at the camp and receive their normal salary during this time.

**San Diego County, CA** has Camp Connect for siblings to have fun together. It also has other activities throughout the year like beach day and SeaWorld Day. All siblings qualify for Camp Connect.

**Frederick County, MD** hosts events like a petting zoo for siblings to get together. Parents are invited, too!

**Michigan** hosts fun events, such as taking families to the movies or trampoline park. They include siblings, even if those siblings are not in care.

**Colorado** has Camp to Belong.
