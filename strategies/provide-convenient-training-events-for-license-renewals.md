Current caregivers are often overwhelmed with day-to-day responsibilities and may miss out on specialized training or put off any required training until just before renewal dates. In some systems, this means the only training available to caregivers is reading books or watching movies, which doesn't give them the best preparation for the needs of youth in their care. 

Offer convenient, high-value training opportunities and events for families that offer childcare and meals to make attending simple and beneficial for everyone.

## How to do this

**Plan ongoing training.** Schedule all-day training events on a recurring basis at times convenient for families, like one weekend a month. Survey caregivers, listen to questions at events, and speak with case workers to identify the most-requested and most-needed trainings, then plan a day-long curriculum around these priorities.

**Make attendance easy.** Secure childcare, provide lunch and snacks, and make transportation accessible by providing bus vouchers or choosing convenient locations. Post the training online with clear instructions on how to sign up, and notify families with renewal dates in the next 4 to 6 months about upcoming training dates.

**Provide meaningful voluntary options for kin.** Don’t require training as a condition for kin caregiver approval or licensure. Kin therefore shouldn’t have to renew approvals unless the original circumstances change, like moving to a new home. Instead, make tailored, optional training available to help them support youth in their care, such as affirming training for LGBTQI+ youth or specialized guidance for grandparents caring for children younger than 5. 

## This strategy in action

**Prince George's County, Maryland** offers training events that help families complete renewal requirements while receiving training.

**Grandfamilies & Kinship Support Network** maintains a list of [available training relevant for kin caregivers](https://www.gksnetwork.org/resources/relevant-trainings-for-kin-caregivers-and-those-who-work-with-them/).
