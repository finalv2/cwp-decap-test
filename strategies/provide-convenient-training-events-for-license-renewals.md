Current caregivers are often overwhelmed with day-to-day responsibilities and may put off their training requirements until their renewal date is approaching. In some systems, this means the only training available to them is reading books or watching movies, which doesn't give caregivers the best preparation for the needs of children in their care. 

Offer convenient, high-value training events with childcare and meals provided to make completing training hours both simple for families and beneficial for everyone.

## How to do this

**Plan regular, convenient training events.** Schedule all-day training events on a recurring basis at times convenient for families, like 1 weekend a month. Survey caregivers, listen to questions at events, and speak with caseworkers to identify the most-requested and most-needed trainings, then plan a day-long curriculum around these priorities.

**Make attendance easy.** Secure childcare, provide lunch and snacks, and make transportation accessible by providing bus vouchers or choosing convenient locations. Post the training online with clear instructions on how to sign up, and notify families with renewal dates in the next 4 to 6 months about upcoming training dates.

## This strategy in action

**Prince George's County, Maryland** offers training events that help families complete renewal requirements while receiving training.
