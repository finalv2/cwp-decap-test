Child welfare agencies often lack the perspective of people who experienced the system. Without it, agencies may miss important problems or make choices that don't work for the youth they serve.

Hire youth with lived experience to ensure that their perspective is represented. This also provides meaningful employment opportunities for youth aging out of care.

## How to do this

**Work with Human Resources to create dedicated positions.** Find the best way to allot positions for youth with lived experience. Child welfare systems have seen hiring them as clerical support, and foster parent trainers and recruiters.

**Provide ongoing support.** If possible, make therapy available and encouraged as part of employment. This helps new employees process feelings or situations that may arise when working in the system.

## This strategy in action

**New Mexico** hires youth with lived experience in various roles within their child welfare system.

**Prince George's County, Maryland** hires a current or former foster youth to conduct foster parent training.
