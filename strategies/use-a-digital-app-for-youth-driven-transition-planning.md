Caseworkers are usually the ones who drive transition planning. But traditional paper-based milestone planning doesn't give youth ownership of their goals, and youth may lose track of important resources and deadlines.

A digital app can empower youth to define their own goals and collaborate with their support team to achieve them.

## How to do this

**Start with a pilot approach.** Work with a small team to [prototype and pilot a web app](https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/wp-content/uploads/Glow-Up-App-Proposal.pdf). Focus on 1 or 2 goal areas that the youth needs or is interested in. Consider partnering with other states and organizations to reduce costs and work at scale.

**Include key features for youth ownership.** Use flexible goal-setting that allows youth to adapt goals suggested by the state or set their own goals. Include suggested steps to help youth break down big goals into achievable steps, links to related resources to help youth access programs and assistance, and progress tracking with reminders and digital achievement badges to motivate continued engagement.

**Create dashboards for supporters.** Include a lightweight dashboard for state human services departments and supportive adults to notify caseworkers when the youthâ€™s inaction is delaying goal achievement or to prompt supportive adults to track goals proactively. Youth's progress is often blocked because they are waiting for action from their caseworker or a supportive adult.

**Plan for security and sustainability.** Include user authentication and authorization so users can save their data and keep it secure. Invest in maintaining and running this service long-term.

**Consider funding sources.** A successful pilot would cost about $350,000 for development and pilot operations. Your state or organization may be able to apply for additional funds from the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program or philanthropic entities like The Annie E. Casey Foundation.

## This strategy in action

A detailed pilot proposal has been developed for a Glow Up app concept that includes all these features. The proposal includes app design concepts, technical considerations for security and privacy, and implementation guidance.
