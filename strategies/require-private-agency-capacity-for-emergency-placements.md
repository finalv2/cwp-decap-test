Even if you contract beds from private agencies, you may find that they don't have capacity for emergency placements. This can lead to placing children inappropriately.

Include requirements for emergency bed capacity in your contracts with private agencies. This ensures guaranteed emergency placement options in family settings.

## How to do this

Include emergency capacity requirements in contracts with private agencies. This should specify a number or percentage of beds that they must reserve for emergencies. You should also define the following:

* What constitutes an emergency bed  
* How quickly agencies must respond  
* Any special requirements

## This strategy in action

**Rhode Island** requires 5% emergency bed capacity from its private agencies.
