Some of the language that child welfare agencies use to describe the end of foster care can be confusing for youth. When they hear that foster care goes "until 21," they may think that means "until their 22nd birthday," when it really ends on their 21st birthday. This may lead them to delay plans and activities that can prepare them for independence.

Use precise language to describe the day that foster care ends so that youth understand.

## How to do this

**Review your materials for unclear language.** Go through your program materials that mention the end of foster care, like posters, pamphlets, website content, and handouts. Look for any places where you say "until 21" or use other vague language.

**Replace it with specific language.** Change any references to "until 21" with "to the end of 20" or "until your 21st birthday." If your program ends at a different age, follow this same pattern.
