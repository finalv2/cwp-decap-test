Current caregivers who do not work for your department can provide additional empathy and perspectives that help new families decide to sign up or expand their placement preferences. 

Hire current caregivers to assist as co-leads in new or continuing trainings, orientations, or early home visits. This increases recruitment and retention for both new families and the caregivers who are hired.

## How to do this

**Develop hiring processes for current caregivers.** Work with your HR department to develop contracts for hiring and paying current caregivers as training co-leads.

**Set clear role expectations.** Establish clear expectations early about the roles for hired caregivers at trainings or other events. They should complement, not replace, experienced trainers and staff.

**Include both foster families and kinship caregivers.** Consider hiring experienced caregivers from both foster families and kinship placements to provide diverse perspectives.

## This strategy in action
