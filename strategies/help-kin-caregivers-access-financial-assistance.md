Kin caregivers may face financial barriers that make it difficult to provide for children and youth in their care, even though they're willing and able to provide safe, loving homes. License kin caregivers regardless of their financial situation and connect them with financial assistance and support programs.

## How to do this

**License kin caregivers without financial requirements.** Don't require minimum income or financial stability to approve kin. Instead, focus on the caregiver's ability to meet the physical, emotional, medical, and educational needs of the child.

**Connect kin caregivers to assistance at the start.** Provide a list of benefits that families may qualify for, or offer one-on-one application assistance. Examples include TANF, SNAP, unemployment insurance, social security, and VA benefits.

**Provide application assistance that’s customized to your area.** This includes providing translated materials and local program information.

**Continue the licensing process while families are working to access financial benefits.** You can complete many steps (like background checks and assessments) while you connect families to support programs.

**Keep providing support after licensing.** Continue connecting families with resources and assistance programs even after the child or youth has been placed. This helps to ensure stability and meet the child or youth's needs.

## This strategy in action

**Indiana** and **Washington State** have implemented programs to help kin families access financial assistance during the licensing process.
