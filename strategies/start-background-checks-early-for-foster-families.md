Out-of-state background checks and fingerprinting appointments can delay foster family licensing. Start these checks as early as possible, even at orientation, to speed up the process and reduce delays for families.

### How to do this

**Ask interested families if they've lived out-of-state** during your initial meeting with them, or even before when possible.

**Find the required out-of-state background check forms** from your state or county's database or from other states' websites.

**Bring laptops to orientation sessions** so interested families can complete online background check forms with help. Make sure paper options are available for those who need them.

**If any forms require notarization**, arrange for a volunteer notary to be present.

### This strategy in action

**Frederick County, MD** starts background checks for foster families at orientation.

**Texas** puts their background check form on a tablet that caregivers can fill out and sign from anywhere.
