After kin, the best placement for a child or youth is with a foster family in their area that shares their language and culture. Sometimes this can be hard to find, but placement teams may miss strong matches simply because a foster family hasn’t finished licensing yet.

Include families who have applied to foster but haven't finished their license in your placement searches. When a child or youth has no strong match, focus on licensing a matching family that’s still in the process first.

## How to do this

**Include families that are still getting licensed in your placement searches.** If there is a match, figure out which steps have to happen right away to license the family and which can wait until after placement. Placement and licensing teams should work together on this.

**Set up interactions while families finish licensing.** If the child or youth doesn't have to move right away, set up visits or other interactions with the matching family while they finish licensing. This can help them build a relationship before being placed.

**Consider judicial orders for strong matches.** In some places, a judge can order a placement with a family that's a strong match but isn't licensed yet.

## This strategy in action

**Frederick County, MD** pays close attention to new families in the application process. They consider whether the families would be a good match for any children or youth who need a new placement or a better-fitting placement. When they find a match, they work with the family to speed up their application process.  

**Washington, D.C.** looks for strong matches between children and youth and new families. In some cases, they set up visits between a child or youth and potential families (with caseworker involvement and approval). This allows them to build relationships while the family is finishing licensing.
