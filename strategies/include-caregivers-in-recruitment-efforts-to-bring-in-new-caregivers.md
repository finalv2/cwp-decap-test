Current kin caregivers and foster parents can be some of your best recruiters. They understand what caregiving really involves and can speak authentically about the experience. 

A strong recruitment strategy will include training and supporting caregivers to leverage their expertise in bringing in new caregivers.

## How to do this

### Pay caregivers for bringing in new caregivers

Pay current caregivers for recruiting new caregivers. This supports them financially while encouraging them to tap into their networks.

Work with your legal and finance teams to figure out how to pay caregivers. You may already have a recruitment or retention contract that allows this.

Track referral sources and milestones clearly, so caregivers are fairly recognized and paid. Tie bonuses to milestones like new caregivers completing licensing or accepting a placement.

If you can't pay cash, consider other rewards, like awards, recognition events, or gift cards.

### Plan recruitment events with caregivers 

Help arrange community events or parties (sometimes called “foster-aware parties”) where current caregivers invite friends and community members who they believe might be interested in caregiving themselves. 

Support caregivers in sharing their experiences and answering questions during these events. Hearing directly from caregivers can encourage inquiries from people who are much more likely to become certified and accept placements.

## This strategy in action

**Washington, D.C.** challenges "squads" of foster families to recruit new families. For each family that gets licensed, the referring family gets a $500 bonus. The squad that recruits the most new licensed families gets a celebration with prizes and food. During the pandemic, they delivered meals via DoorDash.

**Montgomery County, MD** gives foster families a $500 bonus for referring other families. They pay $250 when the new family gets licensed, and another $250 when they take their first placement.
