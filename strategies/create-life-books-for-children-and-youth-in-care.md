Children's histories, relationships, and important memories can easily get lost as they move through the foster care system. You can help preserve these connections by capturing key milestones and relationships in a life book. Create and maintain life books that follow children and youth wherever they go.

## How to do this

**Establish life book requirements.** Print a life book template that captures important milestones, relationships, and memories, then make completing the life book a formal caregiver responsibility. Check on its contents during regular visits, such as monthly check-ins with families. You can also create a digital-only version by creating a free photo sharing website to share with birth families to exchange photos that can also be printed.

**Maintain and share life books throughout a child or youth's journey.** Make copies of the life book for birth family members on a regular schedule, ideally at least quarterly. Make sure a child or youth's life book follows them by including it in any move checklists and in closing permanency checklists for reunification, guardianship, adoption, or a young adult transitioning from foster care.

## This strategy in action

**Frederick County, MD** prints [life book templates](https://child-welfare-playbook-v2.netlify.app/images/life-book-templates-combined.pdf) and puts them in a 3-ring binder.

**Other jurisdictions** have used free online photo sharing websites like [Family Album](http://www.family-album.com) and [Moment Garden](http://www.momentgarden.com).
