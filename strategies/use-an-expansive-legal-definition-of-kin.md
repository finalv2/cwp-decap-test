Many agencies use narrow definitions of kin that only include blood relatives or legal family members. This limits placement options and support networks for children and youth in care, potentially forcing placements with strangers when kin connections are available.

Use an expansive legal definition that includes both biological relatives and people with meaningful relationships to the child or family. This helps staff find more placement options quickly and creates broader support systems for youth.

## How to do this

### Use the recommended definition

> Individuals related to a child by blood, marriage, tribal custom, and/or adoption and other individuals who have an emotionally significant relationship with the child or the child’s parents or other family members.

This definition includes what's often called "fictive kin": people who aren't related by blood, marriage, or adoption but have meaningful relationships with the child or family.

Multiple child welfare advocates came together to unanimously recommend this definition to the federal government as part of the comment period on the kin-specific licensing rule.

**Make the necessary policy or legal changes.** Adopt this definition word-for-word, or adjust your existing legal definition to include all of these categories of kin. This may require a legislative change, though some agencies set the definition of kin in their policy.

**Apply the definition consistently across your processes.** Use it to determine who qualifies for emergency placement, kin-specific licensing waivers and exemptions, and the kin-specific licensing process.

### Accept alternative documentation to prove caregiver relationships

With an expansive legal definition of kin, you also need to expand the types of documentation you accept to prove the caregiver’s relationship with the child or youth. Consider using the following kinds of documentation:

* School, hospital, or social service records that list the kin caregiver as the child or youth's contact
* Health insurance showing the child or youth as the kin caregiver's dependent
* Public benefit statements the kin caregiver receives for the child or youth
* Tax returns listing the child or youth as the kin caregiver's dependent
* Lease agreement showing the child or youth lives with the kin caregiver (without parents)
* Mail to the child or youth at the kin caregiver's address (combined with other proof)
* Professional letter stating the kin caregiver is raising the child or youth[](https://www.regulations.gov/document/ACF-2023-0001-0002/comment?filter=new%20america)
