Even when there are safety concerns, it isn't always necessary to remove a child or youth from their home. 

Hold child safety meetings that include the family, other supportive people, and skilled staff. This can often identify other interventions that keep children safe while keeping the family together.

## How to do this

**Hold a child safety meeting for any safety concern.** This applies ever after emergency interventions, like removing the child.

**Schedule the meeting quickly.** Hold the meeting before implementing a safety intervention whenever possible. If an emergency decision was made, hold the meeting within 2 business days.

**Include the right people.** Bring together parents, children (when appropriate), other supportive people, and agency staff.

**Use the meeting to find alternatives.** Work together to identify the least restrictive intervention that will keep the child safe.

## This strategy in action

**Oklahoma** holds child safety meetings in any situation that might require a safety intervention. They include parents, children and youth (when appropriate), family supports, and agency staff. These meetings have helped Oklahoma serve more children through prevention services and safely reduce the number of children in out-of-home care.
