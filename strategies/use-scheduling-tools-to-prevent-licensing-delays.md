Home study and inspection appointments are often scheduled for families without their input and confirmation. As a result, families can miss important appointments, which is frustrating and delays the licensing process.

Use appointment reminders and calendar tracking to help families stay on top of licensing requirements and prevent delays.

## How to do this

**Send appointment reminders.** Use a shared calendar invite, physical mail, email or text. If possible, ask families what their preferred mode of communication is and send their reminder that way.

**Track critical renewal dates on a calendar.** Other requirements, like CPR certification, training, and pet vaccinations, generally need to be renewed before you can renew a license. But these specific renewal dates rarely line up with the overall license renewal date. Add these renewal dates to your calendar and set a reminder for 30 to 60 days in advance. You can also track these dates in your case management system.
