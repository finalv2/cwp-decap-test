Many youth in care do not have reliable addresses. This makes it difficult for them to receive mail.

Use online calendars, email, and text messages to share information and other materials with youth. This reduces the chance that they will miss important information.

## How to do this

**Post programming calendars online and email them to youth.** You could also use an online calendar that allows people to subscribe to your events, like Eventbrite. As many as 30% of mailed calendars are returned to sender.

**Use text messages for quick updates.** A photo of the calendar could be texted to youth for immediate access.

## This strategy in action

**Los Angeles Opportunity Youth Collaborative** offers an online calendar of upcoming programs that youth can access any time.[](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/los-angeles-opportunity-youth-collaborative-30967055551)
