Many families have complex needs that require them to navigate multiple government services. That means traveling to different government buildings, finding transportation to far-away locations, navigating intimidating security procedures, and waiting for long hours in uncomfortable waiting rooms.

Invite local government service providers to rent space in your community-based family resource center. This increases access to services for families while raising funds for your programs.

## How to do this

**Invite sought-after service providers to rent space.** Reach out to government service providers for benefits such as unemployment, job training and coaching, SNAP, WIC, Social Security, and veterans' services to rent space in your community-based family resource center building.

**Highlight the benefits for everyone.** This increases access to their services, reduces wait times for people in need, and raises funds for your programs. Rent is likely already a line item for these agencies, so it can serve as a new funding source with little paperwork and high return.
