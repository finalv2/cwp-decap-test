Retention percentages can be misleading if youâ€™re not tracking them carefully. Some caregivers leave your system for good reasons, like adopting the child or youth or moving out of state. Others leave because caregiving isn't a good fit for them, which may be best for everyone involved. 

Focus your retention efforts on caregivers who drop out due to frustration or burnout that could have been prevented.

## How to do this

**Define when a caregiver stops serving.** This might be when their license expires, when they submit a termination letter, or when a kin placement ends. If you don't have clear milestones, create one, such as "has not taken a placement in over 12 months."

**Track reasons why caregivers leave.** Capture the reason when caregivers close their license in your CWIS (child welfare information system). You may get diplomatic answers, but it's a starting point for understanding patterns.

**Focus on preventable departures.** Differentiate between problems that could have been avoided with agency action and those that could not. Focus your retention efforts only on the former.

## This strategy in action

**The Center for State Child Welfare Data** provides a framework for categorizing retention reasons in their report "[The Dynamics of Foster Home Recruitment and Retention](/resources/dynamics-foster-home/)." It includes 7 specific categories.

**Washington State** tracks detailed termination reasons. They track more than 20 specific categories.[](https://fcda.chapinhall.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Foster-Home-Report-Final_FCDA_October2018.pdf)
