Social media can help you identify kin that traditional search tactics might miss. Make social media searches part of your regular process for locating and connecting with kin.

## How to do this

**Set up dedicated work social media accounts.** Use agency names or generic identifiers (like "Family Finding 1") rather than worker names to protect privacy. Develop a robust social media policy that covers account setup, privacy, and documentation requirements.

**Search and engage kin through social media platforms.** Search popular social media platforms to find known kin of the child or youth, such as parents or older siblings, focusing on the most up-to-date platforms. Look through public messages, photos, and friend lists of these known connections to identify more kin, including who comments or reacts to posts.

**Send clear, professional messages to potential connections.** Make sure your first message is clear, concise, and includes the caseworker's name and number in case this is the only contact you have. Be careful not to reveal identifying details about the child or youth, or the case.

## This strategy in action

**New Mexico** increased initial kinship placements from 3 percent to over 40 percent in 1 year by shifting to practices that included using social media to identify and reach kin. They encourage workers to create second, separate social media accounts under their name that they use exclusively for work.

**A Second Chance, Inc.** uses Facebook and other forms of social media to [identify at least 40 kin for each child](https://www.asecondchance-kinship.com/programs-services/philadelphia/support-services/family-finding/). 

**Rhode Island** uses accounts under their individual names, but identifies on their accounts that they work for the state. They also clearly identify that they work for the state in each message to potential kin.

**Michigan** includes social media sites on its [Diligent Search checklist](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.michigan.gov%2Fmdhhs%2F-%2Fmedia%2FProject%2FWebsites%2Fmdhhs%2FDoing-Business-with-MDHHS%2FContract-and-Subrecipient-Resources%2FFoster-Care-Forms%2FDHS-0991.dot%3Frev%3Dfa425292062744dfa643ad9bce715742%26hash%3DD65CDDE85BE1AF1DAE5F86FA20C24EEA&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK). 

**Virginia** central family-finding social media accounts are called "Virginia Family Finding 1" (and 2, and 3) to protect worker privacy.[](https://www.gksnetwork.org/resources/kin-mobilization-learning-collaborative/)
