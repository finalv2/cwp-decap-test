Caregivers often leave the system when they feel overextended and undervalued. Recognize current caregivers through awards, events, welcome bags, and other gestures so they feel appreciated and supported. This may also attract potential foster parents or encourage kin to become caregivers through positive word-of-mouth.

## How to do this

**Drop off a welcome bag.** Include a note and a combination of useful items and fun treats for the whole family. Include a mix of contents, some practical and some just fun. Consider the whole family, including the youth in care and any children or other adults already in the home. Provide welcome bags to both foster families and kinship caregivers, adjusting tone and message for kinship caregivers to acknowledge their unique circumstances.

**Send certificates or personal notes to make caregivers feel valued.** Partner with local businesses to donate free or discounted items as awards or gifts for current caregivers. Help partners use alternative documentation to prove caregiver relationships so that discounts can be extended to kin caregivers. Documentation could include any records listing the kin caregiver as the child’s contact or proving the child is a dependent or lives with the caregiver.

**​​Create regular recognition events.** These can be simple gatherings or more formal ceremonies, depending on your resources and what works for your community. If your agency doesn't have the budget for recognition programs, forward this information to local community supporters to create bags or sponsor events on your behalf.

## This strategy in action

**Washington, DC** has "squads" of foster families who support each other with monthly get-togethers and events that include recognition awards and modest prizes. The squads build relationships and help each other through challenges. Each year, there is a competition to see which squad recruits the most new families, with a ceremony and gift card prizes for the winning squad.

Local social service departments in **Maryland** host appreciation events throughout the year. These events have included an annual adults-only reception with free childcare, drive-through celebrations with catered meals, drive-by caravans with signs and music, recognition baskets with games and snacks, and welcome baskets for new families with handbooks, mugs, and books.

**Ohio** uses billboards to recognize individual foster families. Some families take friends to visit their billboard.

**Indiana** works with local businesses to make discounts and offers available for foster families.
