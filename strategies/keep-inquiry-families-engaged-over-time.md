Families often take years between first showing interest in fostering and actually applying. When someone fills out an inquiry form, they might be ready to become a caregiver right away. Or they might need time and more information to think about such a big commitment.

But if too much time passes before they get a response, potential families may get discouraged or change their mind. Keep all inquiries open and, if you have the bandwidth to do so, stay in regular, gentle contact to help families stay engaged until they're ready.

## How to do this

### Respond quickly to new inquiries

**Set a response time of 1 to 7 days for new inquiries.** Track your response times. If they start getting slower, work with your team to respond faster.

**Create an automated email with links to fostering information.** Include ways to support foster youth without becoming a foster parent. Provide a printed version for families who don't use email.

**Look for opportunities to include direct interaction with staff early.** Many potential foster parents need to talk to someone in person or on the phone to feel confident in the process. When there's too much automation up-front, families who aren't a good fit can get far into the process before they talk to a real person. If you don't have staff, consider hiring current foster parents to help with this.

### Start small and build gradually

**Avoid high-pressure tactics.** Some great caregivers take years between submitting an inquiry and applying to foster. Pushing families too hard, too early risks losing them entirely.

**Begin with smaller requests and invitations rather than jumping straight to fostering applications.** Start by inviting families to attend an information session, join your newsletter, or participate in a donation drive.

**Don't limit initial conversations to fostering.** Explore other ways families may want to help, even if fostering isn't right for them right now.

**Make sure your policy is clear about what steps families will need to redo if they start the process but aren't ready to complete it.** This keeps families from repeating the entire process when they're ready to continue, and may gently encourage them to complete the process.

### Keep families engaged over time

**Create a regular newsletter for all families who submit inquiries.** It can be simple, with just a story or a few links. Include information about ways to support foster youth without becoming a foster parent.

**Set up calendar reminders to check in with potential foster families.** Use a task management app or customer relationship management (CRM) system to track which families need follow-ups and when. Make sure the entire team has access to these lists so they can cover check-in calls.

**Find ways to keep in touch without using much staff time.** Use automated newsletters to invite inquiry families to existing events.

**Keep recruiters involved with the families they recruited.** Have recruiters participate in trainings, home visits, or other activities with their families rather than entirely transitioning the relationship to licensing staff. This helps families stay connected to people they feel familiar with and supported by.

### Change your approach to metrics

**Don't focus solely on conversion rates from inquiries to applications.** Also focus on encouraging personal interactions with families and engaging them in smaller commitments like attending events or donation drives.

## This strategy in action

**Frederick County, MD** keeps families engaged even when they take time to complete applications. More families take 6 or more months to apply than complete the application right away. If a family completes PRIDE training but doesn't submit an application within a year, they take a PRIDE refresher. Frederick County also sends interested families a list of 12 ways to support youth without becoming foster parents. They also have recruiters conduct foster parent training. This helps families feel more comfortable as they start the process.  

**Fairfax County, VA** keeps all inquiries open. They’ve found that families take an average of 2 to 3 years to move from inquiry to application. They track families who aren't ready due to short-term issues like a move and set reminders to check in afterward. They also have recruitment team members join a family’s initial home visit for a warm introduction to the licensor.  

**Washington, D.C.** adds new inquiries to their newsletter and checks in with families quarterly. They don't close inquiries and sometimes have families become licensed after being on their inquiry list for a decade.  

**Michigan** sends interested families an email newsletter with agency news, information about children and youth that need placements, and ways to get involved. They use electronic calendar reminders to track check-ins with potential foster families.  

**Oklahoma** checks back with inquiry families within a week, at 14 days, and at 30 days.   

**Ohio** requires all inquiries to receive a response within 7 days and has developed a packet of materials for new inquiries.
