Licensing checklists often include requirements that seem arbitrary or outdated to families and staff. And when decision-makers can't see the legal source behind each requirement, it's hard to know which items can be updated and which require policy changes.

Align licensing checklist items to specific statutes so everyone understands what's legally required and what might be changed.

## How to do this

**Review your current licensing checklist.** Create or locate a list of all the requirements on your checklist, then identify the legal source (statute, regulation, or policy) for each item.

**Update your checklist format.** Add the statute number or legal citation next to each requirement on the checklist. This helps both staff and families understand what's legally required versus what's internal policy.

**Use this information to improve your process.** Review items that are challenging for families. If something is just internal policy (not statute), consider whether you can change or remove it. If it's legally required, think about whether you can make it easier to complete.

## This strategy in action

**Washington State** created a statute-aligned checklist that helps decision-makers understand the legal basis for each licensing requirement.[](https://childwelfareplaybook.com/static/assets/10-183%20Foster%20Inspection%20Checklist.docx)
