The licensing process often involves multiple case workers handling different parts. This delays the process, makes errors more likely, and means each worker only has part of the story about a family.

Assign a single caseworker to handle the entire licensing process for each family. This gives families a consistent contact person and helps the worker understand the family better.

## How to do this

**Keep caseloads small.** A dedicated licensor will only work well if each worker handles no more than 2 to 3 families at a time. Review your current team and find ways to give some workers broader responsibilities in exchange for smaller caseloads.

**Consider restructuring specialized roles.** If you have workers who only do 1 part of licensing, train them to handle more parts of the process. This takes planning and cross-training.

**Start with a pilot program.** Try this with 1 or 2 workers who are interested in being dedicated licensors. Survey the families they work with and compare satisfaction, completion rates, and timing with families who work with multiple staff members.

**Continue to provide clerical support.** Even dedicated licensors need administrative help with paperwork and scheduling.

## This strategy in action

**Frederick County, MD** uses dedicated licensors.
