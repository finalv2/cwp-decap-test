Caregivers need peer support and community connection, but busy schedules and geographic barriers can make in-person meetings difficult. Help families access social media support groups where they can connect with other caregivers, share experiences, and get advice. This increases community among caregivers and serves as an indirect source of recruitment and retention.

## How to do this

**Have an outside group run the support group.** Appoint an outside organization or agency to manage the group. Families aren't as comfortable in agency-run groups and might worry about sharing concerns openly.

**Establish clear crisis protocols.** Make sure the group has clear guidance for what to do if a member is in crisis or if there is suspected child abuse or neglect.

**Keep agency staff out of the groups.** Agency employees should not join these groups to preserve the space for honest peer-to-peer communication.

## This strategy in action

**Michigan** augmented its online foster parent training programs with a private Facebook group during the pandemic to help build community when people could not get together face to face.
