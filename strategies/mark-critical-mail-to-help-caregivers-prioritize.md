Kin and foster caregivers report feeling overwhelmed by the amount of mail they receive. Sometimes it stacks up and time-sensitive documents go unopened. 

Use different color envelopes or put stickers on critical mail to help families quickly identify which envelopes require immediate attention. This helps families respond to requirements quickly, like returning renewal documentation.

## How to do this

**Mark critical mail with a visual indicator.** Use a colored envelope or put a sticker on important mail such as renewal letters.

**Communicate the marking system to families.** Tell families early on that they need to open and respond to any mail with this particular marking or envelope.

**Use the marking system selectively.** Choose your priority mail wisely. If you put a sticker on every envelope, this technique will stop being effective.

## This strategy in action
