Sources that refer families to child welfare may have biases that aren’t immediately clear. For example, they may over-refer Black and Brown families, or refer families for reasons that don't require child welfare involvement. If you aren’t looking for these patterns, they can persist and harm families. 

Analyze referral data to identify bias in referral sources. Use this to provide targeted training and feedback.

## How to do this

**Cross-reference demographic data with referral patterns.** Compare racial and demographic data with screening, testing, and child protection referral numbers.

**Use what you find to target training.** Direct anti-bias training to specific referral sources showing concerning patterns.

**Create standardized practices.** Develop consistent screening and referral practices to reduce subjective decision-making.

## This strategy in action

**Washington State** cross-references racial and demographic data with screening, testing, and child protection referral numbers to identify where bias may be happening. This lets them direct anti-bias training to specific referral sources and develop standardized screening and referral practices.
