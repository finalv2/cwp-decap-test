Kin often face over-collection of information, requests for detailed criminal histories, and unclear explanations about why sensitive information is needed. These practices create fear, delays, and unnecessary barriers. Limit collection to essential information and explain its purpose. This builds trust, speeds up the process, and increases kin participation.

## How to do this

**Collect only essential information**. This includes names, other names used, date of birth, and addresses for the past 5 years from the kin caregiver and other adults in the household. Focus on critical data first. Social Security numbers or tax ID numbers help identify the right person quickly, but name and date of birth are most important for running checks. Avoid collecting demographic information like sex, gender, or race or ethnicity unless you can clearly explain how it will be used. 

Do this as soon as possible after kin indicate their interest in and consent to being a caregiver. Name-based, immediate background checks of state or local criminal history can usually be conducted over the phone, with immediate results. 

You should also collect this information from any people over 18 who regularly live, sleep, and share common areas in the home. This includes adults staying temporarily for more than 2 weeks. This doesn’t include tenants with separate entrances.

**Don't ask applicants to write out their criminal history.** Let background checks reveal criminal history rather than asking kin to self-report. Engage kin caregivers in conversations about their history when needed, but never require them to write down a complete criminal history. Self-reporting can lead to mistakes. And it creates barriers when kin share information about issues that may not actually prevent them from caring for youth.

**Explain why information is needed**. Tell kin caregivers that background checks help protect them and keep the child with them. Explain how sensitive information like Social Security numbers will be used and protected. Provide clear information about what to expect throughout the process and why each piece of information is necessary.

**Avoid repeat collection.** Use information already collected rather than asking for the same details multiple times throughout the process. Figure out what information you’ll need for subsequent checks so that you don’t have to ask for it again. 

## This strategy in action

**Some jurisdictions** subscribe to the FBI’s “Rap Back” service, which notifies you if someone who submitted fingerprints later is fingerprinted again for criminal activity. This can help reduce the need for re-fingerprinting, which can be distressing and unnecessary.
