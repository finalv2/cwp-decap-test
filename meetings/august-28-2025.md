Our guests this month were Noah Duncan and Ben Klosky from the University of Chicago's [Foster Insights](https://www.fosterinsights.org/) team.

In this meeting, Duncan and Klosky share common terms and introduce a framework for thinking about where AI might — and can’t — add value to the complex world of child welfare.
