We heard from Noah Duncan and Ben Klosky from the University of Chicago's [Foster Insights](https://www.fosterinsights.org/) team.<br></br>

The Foster Insights team has been receiving a lot of questions from child welfare agencies interested in using artificial intelligence in their work. In this meeting, Duncan and Klosky share common technical terms, work on building a shared vocabulary, and introduce a simple framework for thinking about where AI could and canâ€™t add value to the complex world of child welfare.
