The Foster Insights team gotten a lot of questions from child welfare agencies who are curious about whether to use general artificial intelligence in their work. In this meeting, Duncan and Klosky share common terms and introduce a framework for thinking about where AI might — and can’t — add value to the complex world of child welfare.
