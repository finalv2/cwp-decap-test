## About the meeting

We heard from Noah Duncan and Ben Klosky from the University of Chicago's [Foster Insights](https://www.fosterinsights.org/) team.<br></br>

Their team has fielded a lot of questions from child welfare agencies curious about using general artificial intelligence in their work. In this meeting, Duncan and Klosky share common terms and introduce a framework for thinking about where AI might — and can’t — add value to the complex world of child welfare.
